# odin-recipes

In this project, I'll be demonstrating everything I've learned about HTML so far and creating a basic website that displays recipes.

I'll be showing off using the correct attributes and using the correct tags such as <html>, <head>, and <body>.

I'll also be formatting the site using headings (<h1> and <h2>), paragraphs (<p>) and anchors <a> to display images, and links to other sites (absolute links), as well as links to other pages (relative links.)
